    - Check special cases of Client msg for the parsing
        =>  I think it's not necessary to handle special cases at the beginning
            since it seems better to be handled in each CMD function.
            Client msg can only include <cmd>, <params>
            however some CMDs' params might contain "," as a sub-param delimeter 
            ex) Command: JOIN
                Parameters: <channel>{,<channel>} [<key>{,<key>}]
    *//DONE//* - Arrange folders to better visualize
    *//DONE//* - Implement User class
    - Implement Channel
    - Draw class hierarchy structure
        =>  Q. If we use nested CMD class ( or functions ) in user( & operator & channel & channel operator ) class ?
            --> To group the classes logically.
            --> ex) 'User' transfoms into 'Operator' with OPER CMD.
                    'User' is a parent class and 'Operator' is a child class.
                    Creating a channel, a user has a pointer to a 'Channel operator' object which is a child class of 'Channel'
                    When a user joins a channel, the user has a pointer to the 'Channel' object.
                    each class has CMD functions accordingly.

# TO test with nc command
In this moment test with this command(or with hexchat) to get cmd saved in this cmd variable.
TERMINAL 1: ./ircserv <PORT>
TERMINAL 2: echo -ne 'GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: example.com\r\n\r\n' | nc 127.0.0.1 <PORT>

It will send like :
    ‚ùØ ./ircserv 6666 1234

    FT_IRC Server up to be inited to 6666
    New client on socket #4
    client #4:
    GET / HTTP/1.1
    Host: example.com
