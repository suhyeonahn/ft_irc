Kyubong:
    - Now, i didn't implement makefile because it's not yet done.
     => I will put makefile if it will be more compact.
    - Server:
        - Manage watch loop better
        - Manage Client quit server
        
Suhyeon:
    - Check special cases of Client msg for the parsing
        =>  I think it's not necessary to handle special cases at the beginning
            since it seems better to be handled in each CMD function.
            Client msg can only include <cmd>, <params>
            however some CMDs' params might contain "," as a sub-param delimeter 
            ex) Command: JOIN
                Parameters: <channel>{,<channel>} [<key>{,<key>}]
    - Arrange folders to better visualize
    - Implement User class
    - Implement Channel
    - Draw class hierarchy structure
